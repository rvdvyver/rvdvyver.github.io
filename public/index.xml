      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m R. I&amp;rsquo;m originally from South Africa and now live in the Netherlands. I started getting into programming when I was 14, and since 2008, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard to improve as a Java developer. I love programming because it lets me come up with useful solutions and keeps me learning new things. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to meet others who share my interests and to work on projects that make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
