Hi there! I'm R. I'm originally from South Africa and now live in the Netherlands. I started getting into programming when I was 14, and since 2008, I've been working hard to improve as a Java developer. I love programming because it lets me come up with useful solutions and keeps me learning new things. I'm excited to meet others who share my interests and to work on projects that make a difference.
